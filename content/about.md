I’m a PhD student at the Centre for Research in Animal Behaviour at the University of Exeter, UK under the supervision of Lauren Brent and Dan Franks. My academic interests are in using data science to understand complex systems. Specific areas of interest include Bayesian statistics, causal inference, and deep learning.

To see a full list of my publications, check out my Google Scholar profile.

I have previously worked on a number of NLP projects, and am interested in bringing these ideas to my future work. I hold a master’s degree in Mathematics from the University of York, UK.

This website is a place for me to archive some of my projects. I’m always open to new opportunities to explore these topics. If you’d like to get in touch, please use the contact form below.
