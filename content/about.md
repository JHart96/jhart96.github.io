I’m a final year PhD student at the Centre for Research in Animal Behaviour at the University of Exeter, UK under the supervision of Lauren Brent and Dan Franks. My academic interests are in using data science to understand complex systems. Specific areas of interest include Bayesian statistics, causal inference, philosophy of science, and deep learning.

To see a complete list of my publications, check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Ymc2m2EAAAAJ&hl=en) profile.

I have previously worked in NLP projects, and am interested in bringing these ideas to my future work. I hold a master’s degree in Mathematics from the University of York, UK.

As well as my academic work, I also provide consulting services to businesses looking to get the most out of their data. My consulting work largely focuses on analysis of surveys and behavioural data.

I’m always open to new opportunities to explore these topics. If you’d like to get in touch, please [send me an email](mailto:jordan.da.hart@gmail.com).
